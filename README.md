# 👋 Hello, I'm Ji Yeyeun

I’m a robotics developer with a strong interest in **ROS 2-based system integration**, **robot arm manipulation**, and **multimodal interaction** including vision and voice.  
I focus on building real-world systems that combine **sensing, control, and user interaction** into a cohesive robotic platform.

---

## 🧩 Interests

- Robot control using **ROS 2** (navigation, manipulation, multi-node communication)
- Visual systems using **OpenCV**, **YOLOv8**, and **Realsense**
- **Voice interaction** using Whisper STT, TTS, and ChatGPT API
- GUI-based feedback and system state visualization
- Real robot integration: Doosan M0609, OnRobot Gripper, Realsense D435

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, C++
- **Robotics**: ROS 2 Humble, tf2, MoveIt, URDF, RViz, Gazebo
- **Vision / AI**: OpenCV, YOLOv8, Realsense SDK, Whisper, TTS/STT
- **Other Tools**: Git, Docker, Ubuntu, tkinter, FSM design
